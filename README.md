# POLYGON MARKETPLACE

Polygon Marketplace is an online Marketplace where users can buy and sell almost anything such as electronics, cars and clothing. The platform is built on the Polygon blockchain which is an Ethereum sidechain which allows for cheaper and faster transactions than Ethereum while still remaining decentralised. 
 
The cryptocurrency industry is rapidly growing and now has a market capitalization of over $2 billion. Many people who hold cryptocurrency would like more ways they can spend and use their tokens. Other platforms such as Travala, which allows users to book trips and hotels with their cryptocurrency has been a massive success, proving the demand for more utility in cryptocurrency. For this reason we felt it would be advantageous to the industry to create a platform which allows a huge number of products to be bought and sold.
